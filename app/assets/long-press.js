// Long press opens the row menu on a touch screen.
//
// Right-click covers the pointer case and is handled in Rust, per row. Touch
// has no right-click, which left every row action unreachable on a phone,
// the menu existed and nothing could open it.
//
// `oncontextmenu` does fire on a long press in WebKitGTK, but only after the
// platform's own selection UI has engaged, and Android's WebView swallows it
// often enough not to rely on. So the gesture is detected here.
//
// WebKitGTK has the mirror-image bug on the mouse path: a right-click fires
// `contextmenu` (which Rust's `oncontextmenu` handles, opening the menu) and
// then *also* fires a plain `click` on the same row, targeting whatever was
// under the pointer when the button went down, which is the row, not the
// menu that has since opened on top of it. Rust's `onclick` for a row
// selects the track, which for a track opens the detail sheet over the
// menu that a moment ago opened correctly. From outside that reads as
// "right-click opens the sheet instead of a menu", because the menu is
// there for one frame and then immediately buried. The swallow-the-next-click
// trick below already existed for long press; a `contextmenu` listener
// arms the same flag for the mouse path.
//
// Delegated from the document and installed once: rows come and go constantly,
// and a listener per row would be thousands of them. The send function is
// swappable so a re-run replaces the channel instead of stacking a second
// copy of every listener.
