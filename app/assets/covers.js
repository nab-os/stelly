// viewport, then drops the attribute so it is never considered again.
//
// Delegated rather than per-row because the alternative is a hook per cover,
// and a favourites shelf holds hundreds. One observer and one mutation
// observer cover every list, grid and drawer in the window, including the ones
// that do not exist yet.
//
// The root margin is also the concurrency limit. WebKitGTK asked for 500
// images at once does not stay interactive; asked for a screenful at a time it
// does. Widen this only with a scroll test to back it up.
