//! The slim catalogue clients sync.
//!
//! `stelly.db` is 269MB, almost none of it read at query time. This projects
//! out what navigation needs: the metadata minus every `qobuz_json` blob,
//! `layout`, `blocked_artists`, and `features` reduced to the CLAP embedding
//! plus a one-field `descriptors_json` carrying only the BPM.
//!
//! That last stub is what `Catalog::load` reads BPM from, by pulling `$.bpm`.
//! About 35MB for a 15k corpus, against 269MB.
